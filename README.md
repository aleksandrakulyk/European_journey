# European_journey
## Simple OOP project helping you choose your next travel destination.
### This repository features an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach with two main classes: Questionnaire and WebScraper. The goal is to suggest a travel destination based on user preferences and current weather conditions in randomly selected countries' capitals.

1. User runs the program.
2. They answer questions about their preferred travel conditions (e.g., climate, activities).
3. The program randomly selects countries, checks their capital cities' weather via web scraping.
4. Based on user preferences and weather conditions, a list of potential travel destinations is presented.
5. The user can select a destination from the list for their next journey.
